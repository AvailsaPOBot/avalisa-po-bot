/**
 * Registration must NEVER take a Pocket Option UID from the request body.
 *
 * It used to. Nothing legitimate sent it — dashboard/src/hooks/useAuth.jsx posts
 * { email, password } and is the only caller — so it was input surface only an attacker
 * would use, and the damage is quiet: poUserId is @unique and first-come-first-served, so
 * registering with a UID you do not own PERMANENTLY BLOCKS the real owner from linking it,
 * and the claim route auto-approves any UID present in AffiliateReferral, so a squatter
 * could collect a free Pro earned by somebody else's referral.
 *
 * This test asserts the BEHAVIOUR (a supplied UID is ignored), not the shape of the code —
 * #117: a guard pinned to wording holds the defect in place.
