⚠️ **The repo `extension/` folder is LIVE** — Mr. Oil's Chrome loads it unpacked.
Never leave it broken or mid-refactor. Smoke test (`node test/extension-settings-smoke.test.js`)
must pass before any commit that touches it. The AGE dispatcher enforces this (fail-closed revert).

## 2.4.22 — 2026-10-06 — expired sign-in no longer shows a Pro user as "DEMO"

Board: "my acc is pro by default but bot ask me to pay for pro". Cause: sessions are
30-day JWTs; once one aged out, `optionalAuthMiddleware` silently treated the caller as
anonymous, `/api/license/check` served the device-fingerprint free plan (10 trades, then
"limit reached / upgrade"), and the panel still showed the user signed in with a DEMO
badge and the claim box. Backend (`/api/license/check`) now returns `sessionExpired: true`
when a sent token can't be accepted, and `refreshedToken` (sliding renewal) once a valid
token is a week old. Extension 2.4.22 applies both (`applySessionHints` in apiClient.js):
renew silently, or sign out with "Your session expired. Please sign in again."
Backend change is backward compatible (extra fields only); the extension needs a Web Store
publish to reach users.

Also in 2.4.22 (found in the 2026-10-06 live Demo test run):
- **Crypto/commodity/stock favourites were never tradeable in Avalisa Bot mode.** The
  favourite label "Bitcoin OTC" normalised to `Bitcoin_otc`, but PO's candle feed (and the
  favourite's own `data-id`) is `BTCUSD_otc`, so the buffer check failed forever ("data not
  ready for Bitcoin_otc (buffer holds BTCUSD_otc)"), each scan loop lost ~10 s on it, and the
  bot stalled when such a pair was the open chart. `normalizeAssetName` now resolves labels
  through the ids PO publishes on the favourites bar, falling back to the label rule.
- Claim panel: an instantly approved claim now says "Pro unlocked" (it used to say "we'll
  review within 24 hours").

## 2.4.21 — 2026-09-12 — audit pass: nothing known left open

Full bug hunt over everything shipped tonight (Codex audit + CEO review), each fix
written as a test that failed first.

Trade safety:
- An `unknown` result used to persist phase `resolved`, an auto-resume phase, so a
  reload could re-fire the same martingale rung while the original order was still
  open. Unknown now quarantines: the bot stops, the ladder is untouched, and Start
  requires an explicit confirmation that PO shows no open orders.
- Deferred Stop could wait forever on a cycle that never resolved, leaving Start
  disabled. A 60s watchdog now ends it into the same quarantine.
- `order_pending` is written durably BEFORE the click; if that write fails, no click.
- A late DOM verdict is attributed by identity (new row + same pair + same stake +
  unique), never by "some row changed" — PO's rows carry no deal id at all
  (measured), so the id-only tier written during the audit was dead code.
- Non-finite per-deal profit (NaN/Infinity) can no longer become a money verdict.
- The deal-identity ledger stops trading when full instead of reusing ids.

Robustness:
- Malformed history/send frames can no longer throw out of the WS listener and kill
  later frames.
- Telemetry and its retries cancel when the account changes, so one account's facts
  can never post under another's credentials.
- Candle ingestion and the archive bound their key cardinality; archive requests cap
  at four in flight and never redispatch a key already in flight.

## 2.4.20 — 2026-09-12 — the candle archive actually collects

2.4.19 shipped an archive that collected ZERO rows. Measured live the same night:
`MarketCandle` stayed empty through a full trading session. Two filters killed every
candle — `candle()` accepted only `period === 30` while the bot was trading M1
(period 60), and `tick()`/`history()` compared PO's raw frame asset (numeric stream
ids) against the display pair, so nothing ever matched.

Fix: stop rebuilding candles from raw socket traffic. Upload the buffer the bot
already built and trades on (`state.candleBuffer[activePair:period]`) — the same
data the signal engine reads, so there is no id guessing and no second parser to
keep in step. Both 30s and 60s are archived (backend and admin export accept either),
still only while the bot runs, still one POST per pair+period per 5 minutes, still
one hour of back-off on `archive_full`.

Lesson recorded: a collector that silently collects nothing looks exactly like a
quiet market. It needed a row count from production, not a passing test.

Second cause, found only by probing the LIVE buffer: PO stamps candles on its own
clock, ~2h AHEAD of local time (measured 7,075s ahead on 2026-09-12). Every
"has this candle closed yet?" test against the local clock said no, so even with
the period and pair fixed the archive stayed empty — and the backend would have
rejected the same rows as future-dated. Closure is now decided by PO's own series
(the newest candle in the buffer is the forming one, everything before it is
closed) and the backend only bounds clock skew (+2 days, -90 days). Archived
candle times are PO's timestamps, not UTC; spacing is what backtests use.

## 2.4.19 — 2026-09-11 — Local candidate, unpublished

Adds read-only market context for every strategy, exact attributed PO deal facts,
execution timing, attempt/pause/stop and session balance events, and a throttled
30-second market candle archive. Backend adds authenticated ingestion, admin
candle export and telemetry statistics. Privacy text updated. Additive SQL files
must be applied by hand before any future deploy; not applied in this task.
Signal rules and martingale sizing are unchanged. Telemetry is best-effort and
never awaited by trade execution.

Safety revision (CEO review, same day): new tables enable row-level security like
every existing table; MarketCandle uses a composite primary key (pair, periodSec,
time) with no surrogate id; the server prunes candles older than 30 days and events
older than 180 days daily in bounded windows (never overlapping); a 1.5M-row cap
(MARKET_CANDLE_MAX_ROWS) answers 202 archive_full and /health reports only a boolean;
the extension uploads candles only while the bot is running, only for the pair it
is on, and backs off for an hour on archive_full. Migration folder renamed to
20260911010000_trade_telemetry_candles.

## 2.4.18 — 2026-09-11 — Local candidate, not published

Preserves the uncommitted 2.4.17 stability candidate. Adds pre-order payout,
martingale step, extension version, result method, signal source and intensity
telemetry. Backend retains trades independently of history display limits and
provides admin aggregate strategy statistics. Migration file is unapplied.
No signal rules or martingale behavior changed.

## Webapp Bot (mobile proof) changelog

### 1.5-expiry-confirmed — 2026-08-15 — the bot now actually sets the PO expiry [Board-approved]
Reported by the Board: panel set to 30s, but the bot never switched Pocket Option's expiry
(PO was left on 3m) and instead fired a trade roughly every 30s, so martingale stepped without
knowing whether the previous trade had won or lost.

Root cause — three compounding defects in `mobile-proof/ios/AvalisaMobileProof/ProofRuntime.js`:
1. `settings.timeframe` was never applied to PO. The webapp runtime only ever *read* the expiry
   (`inferDuration`); `setTimeframe()` existed in the Chrome extension (`extension/poDom.js`) but
   was never ported to the webapp.
2. `durationSeconds()` parsed only `HH:MM:SS`, so any other rendering silently fell back to the
   panel timeframe (30s).
3. `classifyResult()` allowed a `loss` verdict after 10s. A still-open trade looks exactly like a
   loss (stake gone, no payout), so an open 3m trade was booked as a loss and the ladder doubled.

Fixes:
- New `applyTimeframe(tf)`: switches PO's expiry and **confirms it by reading the field back**
  after the picker closes. Runs **before** the amount is set (PO re-renders the panel on expiry
  change). Verified live against m.po.trade: `.block--expiration-inputs .value__val` opens the
  `.dops__timeframes-item` grid (S3/S15/S30/M1/M3/M5) — same markup as desktop PO.
- **Fail closed**: if the requested expiry cannot be set and confirmed, the bot stops with a
  reason instead of trading on an unknown expiry. Applies to demo and real alike.
- Reads never come from inside the open picker (its own option list parses as a duration and
  would falsely "confirm" any target).
- `parseDurationToSeconds()` understands `00:03:00`, `3:00`, `3 min`, `30 sec`, `M3`, `S30`.
- Result resolution waits for the **confirmed** expiry, then polls to settlement (+20s grace);
  `loss` is impossible before the expiry has elapsed. 3 unreadable results in a row stops the bot.
- AI mode applies the AI-suggested timeframe, matching extension behaviour.
- Layout is no longer "ready" unless the expiry field is readable — PO's deposit modal was
  satisfying the amount/CALL/PUT checks on its own.

QC: 72 assertions in a jsdom harness (parser table, both PO layouts, fail-closed paths,
expiry→amount→trade ordering, demo *and* real account paths, the reported regression).
Live on the PO demo account: S30→M1→M5→S30→M3→S30 all applied and confirmed, amount preserved
at $2 across switches, picker closed each time.
NOT yet verified live: a full Start→trade→result cycle — the test account is FREE with 0/10
trades left, so the licence gate blocks placement. Needs trade allowance on the test account.

Mac shell (`mobile-proof/mac/AvalisaMobileProofMac.swift`) gained QC-only, env-gated probes
(`AVALISA_QC_TIMEFRAME`, `AVALISA_QC_DUMP`, `AVALISA_QC_SCRIPT`). Inert unless the env var is set.
`AVALISA_QC_SCRIPT` runs an arbitrary JS file against the page — dev tool; decide before this
shell ever ships to users.

## Extension changelog

### 2.4.17 — 2026-09-11 — late trade identity and safe amount recovery candidate
Local candidate, not published. Retain text/binary successopenOrder events and
reconcile late deal IDs after balance/DOM confirmation using the captured pair,
stake and trade-start window. A close-only match requires server openTime at or
after trade start and exactly one distinct matching ID; ambiguous, stale and
previously used IDs remain unresolved. Timestamp-only attribution stays disabled
and the hidden-tab balance-loss guard remains. Rejected-amount pauses restore
and verify PO's input to startAmount (minimum 1), falling back to 1 if rejected
and warning if PO still refuses;
the paused recovery ladder is unchanged. Per-poll balance/button discovery logs
now use the existing debug gate; results, confirmations and warnings remain visible.
Regression coverage includes late opens, unique/ambiguous closes, stale/reused
IDs, safe input restoration and debug-disabled polling.

### 2.4.16 — 2026-09-11 — expanded stability and strategy QC candidate
Local candidate, not published. Stop tracks pending/open orders through settlement
before enabling Start. Favorite scanning checks cancellation, actual pair, readiness
and fresh payout. Expiry selection reads back the host value. Execution rejects a
pair change after signal selection. Warmup requests the 30-second analysis period
without bypassing history throttling; readiness loads cached candles once per pair
and never overwrites newer live ticks. Flat-price RSI is neutral (50), zero volatility
remains a valid zero, and High intensity tooltips correctly allow OTC.


### 2.4.15 — 2026-09-10 — payout and recovery QC candidate
Local QC candidate; not published. Stop with an explanation when payout is unreadable,
current-pair mode cannot meet the minimum, or an automatic switch cannot confirm the
requested pair and qualifying payout. Disabled monitoring retains its existing behavior.
The existing fresh-sequence-only timing is unchanged. Regression tests reproduce four
failures in 2.4.14 and cover successful/disabled paths.
Removed timestamp-only WebSocket close attribution when the current deal ID is
unknown: another deal's delayed result must not be assigned to this trade.
Existing balance/DOM result fallbacks remain; late-open identity reconciliation
is not implemented in this candidate.
Runtime restore holds in-flight, amount-set and unknown phases for manual
reconciliation instead of scheduling a duplicate order. Safe between-cycle
phases retain automatic recovery. Quick manual Stop/Start remains unaddressed.


### 2.4.14 — 2026-09-02 — the in-product pricing path reaches users
**The only `/pricing` link in the panel lived inside `<div id="av-limit-msg" style="display:none">`** —
it appeared *after* a user exhausted the 10-trade demo and never before. Measured cause of
`pricing_view` sitting at 1-9/week against ~680 installs: the funnel was starved at the top,
not failing to convert.
- `overlayView.js` / `content.js` (`8e1c9d9`): a persistent **Plans** link in the panel footer,
  independent of the limit message; the pricing CTA is now `av-btn-primary`; the affiliate button
  relabelled **"Free Pro — needs a NEW PO account"** so the one condition that disqualifies most
  readers is stated before they click.
- Guard `extension/test/panelPricingReachable.test.mjs` asserts a pricing path exists outside any
  `display:none` container.
- `c19ec8a`: removed the dead AI token-status fetch from init — 2 DB queries on every start
  writing three fields nothing read. Backend route intentionally kept: ~680 installed copies still
  call it until their users update.
- `2afe41d`: affiliate link collapsed to one constant per built artifact, guarded by a test that
  asserts the literal appears exactly once.
- ⚠️ **Built and committed `923c84a`, NOT yet on the shelf.** Google locks the item while the
  previous version is in review (`ITEM_NOT_UPDATABLE`), so submission waits on 2.4.13 rolling out.

### 2.4.13 — 2026-08-31 — Web Store listing leads with the free demo (`cde5302`)
Listing copy and tagline rewritten so the first thing a visitor reads is that the demo needs no
payment and no card. Store package updated; the public shelf lagged for days behind Google review.

### 2.4.12 — 2026-08-30 — new users could not create an account (`a9cff23`, `6f5f2fa`)
The extension login had **no route to registration** — a new install could sign in and nothing
else. Added account-creation links, and raised the login frame so the explanatory note was no
longer clipped.

### 2.4.11 — 2026-08-30 — affiliate Pro claims reachable before the trade cap (`adddfd6`)
The claim door sat *behind* the 10-trade demo limit, so the users the affiliate funnel is meant to
convert had to burn the demo before they could claim what they were already entitled to.

### 2.4.10 — 2026-08-28 — version bump so a pending fix could ship (`961edb3`)
No behaviour change of its own. The Web Store rejects a re-upload at an existing version, so the
already-verified fix could not be published without a bump.

### 2.4.9 — 2026-08-17 — Avalisa AI could never trade at Mid/High + credential leak [Board-approved]

Found by driving the **published 2.3.19** build live on the PO demo account. Martingale passed
end-to-end (ladder, reset-on-win, alternating direction, 2-step recovery, payout auto-switch all
correct). Avalisa AI did not: at Mid it scanned 7 favourites over ~2 minutes and placed **zero**
trades, every scan reporting `loading_13_20`.

**Root cause — the candle gate was set above what Pocket Option can supply.**
Measured directly off the socket: every history frame carries a fixed **~1300-1400 raw ticks
(~11 minutes)**, so usable candles = span ÷ period, and asking for a longer window does not work:

| period | ticks | span | candles |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30s | 1369 | 666s | **22** |
| 60s | 1299 | 633s | **10** |
| 300s | 1393 | 678s | **2** |

Scanning ran at the 60s expiry period, yielding ~10-14 candles against gates of mid **20** and
high **30** — unsatisfiable. High was unreachable at *any* period the engine supports. Mid is the
default intensity, so for most users the paid Avalisa AI feature silently did nothing forever.
Low (12) only worked by luck and still failed on seeds that came back at 10.

Fixes:
- `AI_ANALYSIS_PERIOD_SEC = 30`. The whole AI data path (`ensureAvalisaDataForCurrentPair`,
  `prefillCandleHistory`, `watchPOSelectionForAvalisa`) now warms and reads **30s** candles
  instead of whatever the expiry happened to be. The expiry a signal picks is unchanged and is
  still applied at trade time.
- `REQUIRED_CANDLES_BY_INTENSITY` 12/20/30 → **12/16/20** — all reachable from a 30s seed, all at
  or above the 15 closes RSI-14 needs. Intensity strictness is unchanged and still comes from
  `signalEngine.js` (minConfidence 35/68/95, rulesRequired, requireCandleConfirm, skipOTC); the
  candle count was only ever meant to be a data-sufficiency floor.
- **`avalisaRequestHistory` never worked.** Verified live: PO ignores `loadHistoryPeriod`
  completely, at every index — it returns nothing. The bot only ever received candles as a side
  effect of `changeSymbol` when the scanner clicked a pair. It now sends `changeSymbol`, which is
  the verb PO answers and which lets us name the period.
- **History was filed under the wrong period.** The seed handler hardcoded
  `histPeriod = getCurrentPeriodSeconds()` (the UI expiry) and threw away `parsed.period`, on the
  belief that the field was PO's transport granularity. It is not — verified live, `parsed.period`
  is exactly the period named in `changeSymbol` (confirmed at 30/60/300). So a requested 30s seed
  was re-bucketed as 60s, collapsing ~24 candles back down to ~14 and defeating the pin above.
  Now bucketed by the declared period, falling back to the expiry only if PO omits the field.
  (Caught by the readiness test below, not by inspection.)
- Scan log carries `asset`/`period` on the not-ready path — it printed `pair=undefined` on exactly
  the failures you need to read.
- Per-frame `HISTORY binary received` / raw-payload dumps moved behind `debugLog`; the one-line
  `HISTORY seeded N candles` summary stays visible.

**Credential handling (security):**
- `#av-password` kept its value in **po.trade's own DOM** indefinitely after login, so PO's page
  scripts — or any other extension — could read the Avalisa account password with one
  `getElementById`. Confirmed by reading it from the page's main world. `handleLogin` now consumes
  and wipes the field on read.
- `diagnosePOInterface()` ran on **every Start** and logged every input's `value`, printing the
  password in clear text (and a Google OAuth authorization code from a PO field). It no longer
  logs values at all — password inputs are `<redacted>`, others report length only — and the whole
  dump is now behind the debug flag.
- `WS EVENT` / `Socket.IO binary placeholder` / `WS raw msg` / close-event traces moved behind
  `debugLog` (`localStorage.avalisaDebugLogs = '1'`). These fired on every socket frame of a live
  trading page.
- Login inputs marked `autocomplete="off"` / `"new-password"`. Verified after the wipe landed:
  Chrome's own password manager refills the credential into the page on every load, re-creating
  the exposure. This reduces it but is **not** a complete defence — Chrome may override the hint.
  **Open item for the Board:** the only real fix is moving login out of po.trade's DOM into the
  extension popup, which has its own origin. Tracked in `212-status` Known Gaps.

**Signal engine v3 — intensity now means one thing (Board-directed 2026-08-17):**
`signalEngine.js` rewritten. Intensity used to move the RSI bands, Bollinger width, pullback
zone, regime and volatility thresholds, the confidence floor AND an OTC ban all at once, so
"stricter" was several hidden things and per-rule verdicts were not comparable between levels.
Now the bands are **identical at every intensity** and the only dial is how many of four rules
must agree: **Low 2, Mid 3, High 4**.
- **High no longer skips OTC.** It set `skipOTC: true`, and since most of PO's always-on
  catalogue is OTC, High refused nearly everything even when its signals were good. The
  `otc_filter` skip reason and its panel message are gone.
- Rules are now explicit, named and per-direction, four in each regime:
  trending → `trend`, `pullback`, `rsi_zone`, `confirm`;
  ranging → `rsi_extreme`, `bb_break`, `momentum`, `confirm`.
- `confidence` is a real proportion (`matched / 4`). It used to be
  `(matched / required) * minConfidence`, which at the point it was tested could never fall
  below `minConfidence` — so the `low_confidence` branch it guarded was **unreachable dead code**.
  Removed along with `minConfidence`.
- `no_signal` → `not_enough_rules`, and that reason no longer counts toward the no-progress
  cooldown: looking and not being convinced is a normal outcome, not a stall.

**Two defects found during the live run (2026-08-17) — both PRE-EXISTING, not 2.4.9 regressions:**

1. **Martingale could not change the Pocket Option expiry, and looped forever without trading.**
   Reproduced live: panel set to S30 while PO was on M1 → `setTimeframe: could not find option
   for S30`, status oscillating CALL/PUT every ~8s, balance frozen, zero trades. Cause: PO renders
   the quick-expiry buttons as **`+S30` / `+M1`** when the panel is in "add duration" mode, and all
   three matching passes in `setTimeframe()` used strict equality against `S30`. Nothing ever
   matched. The bot only worked when PO's expiry already happened to equal the panel's — which is
   why earlier testing missed it. `chooseAvailableTimeframeFallback()` had the same blind spot, so
   the fallback could not rescue it either. Both now normalise (`^[+-\s]+` stripped, upper-cased).
   Verified live after the fix: `setTimeframe: clicked grid item S30` → trade opens → $1 loss →
   $2 win +1.84, ladder reset. This affects the published 2.3.19 identically.

2. **A favourite could be evaluated against the previous pair's candles.** Measured 1 scan in 12:
   `pair=AEDCNY_otc favorite=Bitcoin OTC` — the pair switch had not completed inside the 7s window,
   so `ensureAvalisaDataForCurrentPair()` returned false, the caller ignored the return value, and
   `evaluateAvalisaCurrentPair()` read whatever was still buffered. A non-SKIP verdict there would
   have traded the newly-selected pair on another pair's indicators. The scan loop now checks the
   return value AND that `state.activePair` matches the pair actually on screen, skipping with an
   explicit "data not ready" line instead of evaluating stale data.

**Panel is draggable, popup mascot corrected, PO-linked entitlement (2026-08-17):**
- The on-page panel drags by its header — grab cursor, position remembered per browser,
  double-click the header to snap back, clamped so it can never be dragged off-screen. Verified
  live: dragged −320/+180, survived a page reload, reset worked. **The Chrome toolbar popup
  cannot be made movable** — the browser anchors it to the toolbar — so the movable surface is
  the panel that actually covers the chart.
- Popup mascot now uses the official champagne-dress cutout (`avalisa-hero-girl-gemini.png`,
  git-tracked). The previous image was
  `dashboard/public/images/landing/generated/avalisa-girl-cutout-highres.png` — **gitignored,
  referenced nowhere**, a leftover from an image-generation run; deleted at the Board's request.
- **`POST /api/license/po-entitlement`** — a linked PO account unlocks the modes with no typing.
  Deliberately **not** a login: the caller asserts its own UID and the server cannot verify it
  controls that PO account, and UIDs are semi-public, so the route returns entitlement only
  (plan + allowance), never a token/id/email/history, and grants no ability to change anything.
  Worst case is bot modes unlocked on the guesser's own PO account — licence leakage, not account
  takeover. Only the admin-locked `poUserId` counts; a pending claim unlocks nothing. A real
  session still wins and remains required for settings sync, history and support.
  `backend/test/poEntitlement.test.js` locks the contract (no auth words, whitelisted response
  fields only, `select: { id }`, keyed off `poUserId`, UID validated). Mutation-checked.

**A trade could inherit a neighbouring trade's result (2026-08-17).** Reported: a LOSS that did
not double the ladder.

```
23:34 $2 ✓   23:35 $1 ✗   23:36 $1 ✗   23:37 $2 ✓
                  ^ this loss did not ladder — 23:36 repeated $1
```

`readWsTradeResultSince()` matched close events **by timestamp only** and took the LAST one newer
than the trade start. PO's `successcloseOrder` for the previous trade can land just after the next
trade opens, so the new trade read the old verdict — a stale **WIN** "reset" a ladder already at
$1, silently swallowing the loss. Batched frames made it worse: `extractResultFromCloseEvent()`
read `deals[deals.length - 1]`, which is not necessarily our deal.

`successopenOrder` carries the deal `id` and every closed deal repeats it, so the pairing can be
exact. Now:
- `waitForTradeOpen()` records `state.currentDealId` from the socket open event.
- The cycle clears `currentDealId` before each order, so a stale id can neither mis-pair nor block.
- `readWsTradeResultSince()` looks for **our** deal id inside `deals[]` and returns nothing until it
  appears — it will not fall back to another deal's verdict. Time-based matching remains only when
  no open event was seen and there is no id to match on.

Verified live — every verdict is now stamped with its deal:
`deal cba4ba03… → RESULT: LOSS via successcloseOrder#cba4ba03 → $1→$2`,
`deal 6c85e645… → RESULT: WIN via successcloseOrder#6c85e645 → reset $1`.

`test/extension-deal-attribution.test.js` covers the stale-neighbour case, batched frames in either
order, ties, the no-id fallback, and pre-trade events. Mutation-checked.

**Stale preserved ladder resurrected an old rung (2026-08-17).** Reported: after a WIN reset the
next session opened at **$4** instead of $1.

```
22:39 $1 ✗  22:39 $2 ✗  22:40 $4 ✓   <- ladder reached $4/step 2, then WON and reset
22:41 $1 ✓  22:42 $1 ✗  22:43 $2 ✓
...19 minutes, no trades on ANY asset (checked PO's full closed list, not just AUD/USD)...
23:02 $4 ✗   <- Start resurrected the stale $4/step-2 snapshot
```

`preservePausedLadder()` (v2.4.8, so a half-finished recovery is not abandoned on a safety stop)
wrote `{currentAmount: 4, martingaleStep: 2}` during that first ladder. But `clearPausedLadder()`
only ran on **consumption** or **manual Stop** — never when the ladder actually resolved — and
`PAUSED_LADDER_MAX_AGE_MS` is **30 minutes**. So an already-won, 22-minute-old ladder was still
"resumable" and the next Start opened at $4.

Fix: `applyMartingaleLogic()` clears the preserved ladder whenever the live ladder returns to
**step 0** (a win, or a max-steps reset). A mid-ladder loss still keeps it, and TIE/unknown still
hold without touching it — those are the cases the feature exists for. A resumed ladder now also
announces itself in the panel (`Resuming paused ladder at $X (step N, saved Nm ago)`) instead of
silently opening on a large stake.

`test/extension-paused-ladder.test.js` covers win-reset, max-steps reset, mid-ladder loss and
TIE/unknown. Mutation-checked.

**Trade open + result now come from Pocket Option's socket (2026-08-17, Board-approved).**
Reported from live trading: the ladder repeated rungs — `$16` then `$16`, and `$64` again straight
after a `$64` win paid +58.88, i.e. **$128 of real exposure on a "$64" rung**.

Two layers, both measured live:
1. `waitForTradeOpen()` accepted only an ABSOLUTE drop below `balanceBefore − amount×0.3`. When the
   previous payout lands inside the window the balance goes **up**, the stake never crosses that
   level, the order is called unconfirmed and the cycle re-fires the same rung while the first
   order is live. It already saw PO list a new deal but used it only for a log line.
2. Underneath that: **PO sends its authoritative events as BINARY socket frames.** `parseWsMessage`
   only handled text `42[...]` frames, so `recentCloseEvents` was permanently empty and every
   verdict fell through to balance heuristics. In a **backgrounded tab** Chrome throttles timers
   and PO's balance lags — measured **31s** to see a stake (on a 30s trade) versus **1–2s** in the
   foreground — and a $1 **win was booked as a LOSS** because the +1.92 landed after the verdict.
   That is what drives a runaway $1→$64 ladder.

Fixes:
- `injected.js` remembers the `45x` placeholder's event name and forwards the following binary
  frame as `AVALISA_WS_BINARY` with that name, instead of anonymising it as a price tick.
- `content.js` consumes **`successopenOrder`** (authoritative open) and **`successcloseOrder`**
  (authoritative result) from those frames.
- `waitForTradeOpen()` prefers the socket open event, then a **step-down of ~the stake between
  consecutive samples** (survives a payout mid-window because it measures the delta, not the
  level), then a new deal in PO's list. On timeout with a deal present it returns `opened:true`:
  the errors are asymmetric — calling it open at worst books one trade `unknown` and the ladder
  HOLDS, calling it closed doubles real money.
- `extractResultFromCloseEvent()` reads `deals[].profit`, not the outer `profit`. Real payload is
  `{profit: 0, deals:[{profit: -1}]}` — a **loss** that the old order-of-checks called a "tie".
- **Interim guard (B):** while `document.visibilityState === 'hidden'` the resolver refuses to book
  a balance-derived **loss** (wins and ties still register). A throttled tab cannot be trusted to
  have received the payout yet, and the cost of a wrong loss is a doubled stake.

Verified live with the PO tab **backgrounded** — the exact condition that broke it:
`Trade confirmed via PO socket (successopenOrder)` in **1–2s**, `RESULT: … via WS event:
successcloseOrder`, rungs `1 → 2 → 1 → 2` laddering and resetting correctly, and **zero
balance-derived loss verdicts**.

Tests: `extension-trade-open-confirm.test.js` (replays the payout-masking sequence + the socket
path) and `extension-ws-result.test.js` (real `successcloseOrder` payload shape, and the hidden-tab
loss guard). Both mutation-checked. 11 extension + 8 backend tests pass.

**Test-Fix Loop 2026-08-17 — the expiry panel was three bugs, not one.** The `+S30` fix recorded
below was itself wrong and is superseded. Root cause, from driving PO live:

PO's expiry block has **two modes** and one control doing double duty.
- `.block--expiration-inputs a` is the **MODE TOGGLE** (duration ⇄ absolute clock time), not a
  picker opener. `setTimeframe()` clicked it to "open the picker", flipping the panel into clock
  mode where the list becomes `+S30 / +M1 / +M2…` meaning "**add** 30s to the expiry clock".
  Confirmed live: clicking `M1` there set the expiry to `19:20:00`.
- So the earlier "normalise `+S30` → `S30`" change would have **armed trades of the wrong
  length**. Reverted. A `+` item now means "wrong mode": close, `ensureDurationPanel()`, retry
  once — never click it.
- `.block--expiration-inputs .value` opens the real duration list
  (`S3 S15 S30 M1 M3 M5 M30 H1 H4`) without touching the mode, and is now the primary
  `durationTrigger`. `.value__val` toggles it *shut*, so it is ordered last.
- The trigger **toggles**. PO often leaves the list open, so the click closed it, the code read
  `items found: 0` and retried forever without trading. It now clicks only when the list is shut,
  retries the open once, and on failure closes the panel instead of blind-toggling (a list left
  open is what poisoned the next attempt).

Verified live — both previously-broken paths now trade with the correct expiry:
clock mode + `S30` → `switched successfully` → `openOrder … time:30`;
duration `M1` → `S30` with the list already open → `clicked grid item S30` → `openOrder … time:30`
→ WIN, ladder recovers ($1 loss → $2 → WIN +1.84).

False-intent checks over a 5-order soak: **0 duplicate orders**, **0 orders after Stop** (90s
watch), every order `isDemo:1`, every `time` matching the selected timeframe, no exceptions.
AI mode re-verified after the poDom change: signals, favourite switching and pair attribution
all correct.


**Renamed "Avalisa AI" → "Avalisa Bot" (Board-directed 2026-08-17):** the strategy is a fixed
four-rule checker evaluated locally — no model, no live analysis, no network call. Calling it AI
oversold it, and now that the panel shows the actual rule checklist the honest name matches what
the user sees. Renamed across the extension UI, the live dashboard (`dashboard/src`), the
public pricing/landing copy, the support-bot system prompt (`backend/src/routes/support.js`) and
the Webapp Bot (`mobile-proof/`).

⚠️ **The stored value is still `strategy: 'ai'` — deliberately.** It sits in every existing
user's `chrome.storage.local` and is sent to the backend with each trade; the live CWS 2.3.19
build talks to the same backend. Renaming the wire value would be a migration that resets saved
settings and breaks the published build, for no user-visible gain. Same reasoning for the
`/api/ai/*` routes and the `aiTradesAllowance` / `aiTradesUsed` license fields. Only labels moved.
Guarded by a naming assertion in `test/extension-ai-candles-and-secrets.test.js`, which checks the
option is labelled "Avalisa Bot" while `value="ai"` is preserved, and that no user-visible string
says "AI".

NOT renamed: `dashboard/public/concepts/` and `dashboard/design-spec/` (archived concept mockups
and design history, publicly reachable but not the live product pages) — Board decision pending.

**Live rule readout in the panel (Board-directed):** a new signal box under Status shows the
pair, regime, leading direction, an `N/M rules` score and a ticked checklist of exactly which
rules are met, plus a `checked Ns ago` heartbeat that turns red past 90s. Without it a scan that
is working but unconvinced looked identical to a frozen panel. Hidden outside Avalisa AI mode.
The SKIP status line now also reports `2/4 rules (mid)` instead of a bare reason.

**Sign-in moved to the toolbar popup (Board-approved, CWS-compliant):** the on-page panel no
longer contains any credential field — `#av-email` / `#av-password` and `handleLogin` are gone
from the content script, replaced by a note pointing at the toolbar icon. `popup.html` /
`popup.js` now own the login request; the content script learns about the session through a
`chrome.storage.onChanged` listener and only ever sees the JWT. Checked against Chrome Web Store
program policy first: nothing prohibits authentication in a popup, and the policy requirement to
"keep authentication information secure" argues for the move — a password in a third-party page's
DOM was the riskier design. Also fixes the autofill re-exposure noted below, since Chrome's
password manager has no PO-origin field left to refill.

Remaining verbose tracing (`FETCH`, `XHR`, `WS SEND`, per-tick `WS_TICK`/`TICK ingest`) moved
behind `debugLog` as well.

Tests:
- `test/extension-ai-candles-and-secrets.test.js` — static guard: fails if a candle gate is set
  above a real PO seed, if the analysis period is unpinned, if `loadHistoryPeriod` returns as the
  history verb, if the password is logged or left in the DOM, or if socket tracing is un-gated.
- `test/extension-ai-readiness.test.js` — integration proof: replays a **real** PO history frame
  (`test/fixtures/po-history-30s.json`, AUDCAD_otc @30s, 1558 ticks/750s, captured live
  2026-08-17) through the extension's own ingest path and asserts every intensity reaches a real
  decision instead of `loading_N_M`. On the fixed build: 26 candles → low `SKIP/conflicting_signals`,
  mid **`PUT/ok`**, high `SKIP/otc_filter`. On 2.4.8 mid and high stall forever.
- `test/extension-signal-intensity.test.js` — proves Low/Mid/High = 2/3/4 rules, that a 4-of-4
  **OTC** setup now fires at High, that a 2-of-4 setup fires only at Low, that every verdict
  carries a labelled checklist, and that confidence is a true proportion.
- `test/extension-popup-auth.test.js` — drives the real `popup.html` + `popup.js` against a
  stubbed backend: a successful login stores the JWT and clears the password box, a rejected one
  stores nothing and keeps the user's typing.
- `test/extension-ai-readiness.test.js` also asserts the panel readout renders four rules, ticks
  exactly the matched ones, shows an `N/M rules` score and a `checked …` heartbeat, and hides
  itself outside AI mode.
- `test/extension-settings-smoke.test.js` now reads the expected build badge from the manifest
  instead of a hardcoded `v2.4.8`, which turned every version bump into a fail-closed smoke failure.

⚠️ **Browser-level smoke was NOT possible from the command line.** Chrome 151 no longer honours
`--load-extension` (tried headless and windowed, with and without `--disable-extensions-except`);
the extension never loaded, so nothing here has run inside a real browser. All 9 tests are jsdom
against the real extension sources. Loading it once via `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode →
**Load unpacked** is required before any CWS publish.

Rollback tag `pre-ai-candle-fix-2026-08-17`.

NOT yet verified: a live Mid/High run placing trades (see vault log — the fixed build has not been
loaded into a browser; the profile used for testing runs the CWS 2.3.19 build).

### 2.4.8 — 2026-07-02 (tag `v2.4.8-ladder-fix`) — ladder-stability rework [Board-approved]
- **Never abandon a live martingale ladder.** Root-cause fix for "martingale fails after a while"
  on local 2.4.x builds (published 2.3.19 was unaffected):
  - `getBalance()`: dedicated selectors first (visibility-guarded), free-text parse fallback only.
  - Stake-above-balance pause now requires a **double-confirmed** balance (two agreeing reads).
  - Amount-control recovery allows **2** self-heal reloads (was 1), session persists through.
  - Unexpected cycle errors: retry ×2 with backoff → one self-heal reload → only then stop
    (was: stop on first strike).
  - **Every safety stop preserves the ladder** (`avalisaPausedLadder`); next Start resumes the
    saved stake/step if martingale settings unchanged (30-min window). Manual Stop clears it.
- Re-exposed `tradesCount` in `avDebug()` (the fail-closed publish gate live-test waits on it).
- Soak harness added: `~/avalisa-age/extension-soak-test.mjs` (multi-hour demo run, JSONL log).

### 2.4.7 — 2026-07-02 (AGE job-4)
- Centralized all PO DOM selectors into `PO_SELECTORS` (`config.js`). Refactor only.

### 2.4.1 → 2.4.6 — 2026-06-22…25 (AGE job-4 + live-test session)
- 2.4.1: catch-all safe-stop on unexpected trade-cycle errors (superseded by 2.4.8 retry logic).
- 2.4.2: version proof badge (`av-build-badge`) for live QA.
- 2.4.3: hide stale "limit reached" warning.
- 2.4.4: persist runtime session (ladder survives PO reloads).
- 2.4.5: pause impossible recovery loops (superseded by 2.4.8 double-confirm + resume).
- 2.4.6: prefer visible PO balance text (superseded by 2.4.8 selectors-first + visibility guard).

### 2.4.0 — 2026-06-21
- Version reconcile: repo source == shipped 2.3.19 content + layout-health guards.
